                            100% happy with the product.
                            Even if it comprises requirements behind the line,
                            I am willing to go there,
                            because in the end,

                            The pricing is always the unsure factor,
                            but I strive to make it as reasonable as possible.
                            I use only 1 type of pricing for all of my projects.
                            It's called the 33 / 33 / 33 rule
                            and you might guess it straight from the name
                            - I get 33% before the project starts
                            (but after I recieve all of the information),
                            33% in the middle of the job
                            (but after you see some prime results)
                            and 33% after it's all completed.
